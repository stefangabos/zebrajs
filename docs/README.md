# ZebraJS

A truly modular, jQuery compatible, ultra-lightweight (**13Kb minified, 4Kb gzipped**), JavaScript micro-library for modern browsers (IE 10+) meant to simplify the interaction with the DOM in the *post-jQuery* world, now that there are there are less and less differences between how browsers handle various JavaScript-related aspects and offer native support for most of the things that [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) had to tackle and take care for us, behind the scenes, since its first release [back in 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery).

Nevertheless, the need for a library to handle common tasks needed when interacting with the DOM becomes obvious for anyone writing JavaScript on a daily basis, as there's quite some code to write to handle various aspects of DOM manipulation.

**ZebraJS** retains [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)'s intuitive and simple syntax but the code behind is largely inspired from the excellent [You Don't Need jQuery](https://github.com/oneuijs/You-Dont-Need-jQuery) GitHub repository as well as the documentation on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web), and makes use of the modern browsers' improved support for manipulating DOM elements. Also, in line with the modern age's pursuit for byte saving, ZebraJS allows you to build [customized versions](https://stefangabos.github.io/zebrajs/download/) of the library and include just the bits you need.
