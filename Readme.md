# ZebraJS

A truly modular, jQuery compatible, ultra-lightweight (**13Kb minified, 4Kb gzipped**), JavaScript micro-library for modern browsers (IE 10+) meant to simplify the interaction with the DOM in the *post-jQuery* world, now that there are there are less and less differences between how browsers handle various JavaScript-related aspects and offer native support for most of the things that [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) had to tackle and take care for us, behind the scenes, since its first release [back in 2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery).

Nevertheless, the need for a library to handle common tasks needed when interacting with the DOM becomes obvious for anyone writing JavaScript on a daily basis, as there's quite some code to write to handle various aspects of DOM manipulation.

**ZebraJS** retains [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)'s intuitive and simple syntax but the code behind is largely inspired from the excellent [You Don't Need jQuery](https://github.com/oneuijs/You-Dont-Need-jQuery) GitHub repository as well as the documentation on [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web), and makes use of the modern browsers' improved support for manipulating DOM elements. Also, in line with the modern age's pursuit for byte saving, ZebraJS allows you to build [customized versions](https://stefangabos.github.io/zebrajs/download/) of the library and include just the bits you need.

## Installation

Download the [full library](https://github.com/stefangabos/zebrajs/archive/master.zip) from GitHub (and use either `dist/zebra.min.js` or `/dist/zebra.src.js`), or go on and [get your customized version](https://stefangabos.github.io/zebrajs/download/).

zebrajs is also available as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zebraJS). To install it use:

```bash
# the "--save" argument adds the plugin as a dependency in packages.json
npm install zebraJS --save
```

zebrajs is also available as a [Bower package](http://bower.io/). To install it use:

```bash
# the "--save" argument adds the plugin as a dependency in bower.json
bower install zebraJS --save
```

## Examples

The most important thing this library does, similarly to jQuery, is to simplify the process of selecting DOM elements by providing a unified wrapper for JavaScript's [querySelector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector), [querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) and [getElementById](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById) via a shorthand function called, by default, `$` (dollar sign) and which can be renamed to whatever character or string allowed by JavaScript.

```javascript
// always cache selectors
// to avoid scanning the DOM over and over again
var elements = $('selector')
```

As with both querySelector and querySelectorAll, the `selector` string may contain one or more CSS selectors separated by commas:

```javascript
var elements = $('div.authentication .form-container.authentication input[type=text]');
```

> I cannot stress enough how important it is to understand the fact that **everytime** you call the **$** global function you will create a new object that will take up memory - ZebraJS does not cache selectors! Therefore, you should **never** use it in an event handler or a function that gets called multiple times over the lifetime of a page and instead **cache those selectors outside those functions!** Yes, this true for jQuery, also.

Once you grab hold of one or more elements (we call this *wrapping elements* because we *wrap* the ZebraJS object over the selected elements) you can call any of [ZebraJS's methods](https://stefangabos.github.io/zebrajs/index.html).

## Where to use ZebraJS

I use this to fuel my (small) pet projects where jQuery is overkill and plain JavaScript is too verbose. Also, more often than not, I just need very little from jQuery, and hence the modular approach.

Keep in mind that this library is currently in its infancy so adjust your expectations accordingly.

## Contributing

Make sure you have installed [Node.js, npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). Once you have those, open up a terminal in the project's folder and run `npm install`. Next time you'll just have to type `grunt` in your terminal while in the project's folder.

From this point on, when you edit the project's files in the `/src` folder, Grunt will automatically run tasks that will check whether you follow the project's coding standards via [ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/about/), will do static code analysis via [JSHint](http://jshint.com/about/), will use [Uglify](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) on the code and will generate the documentation with [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) (documentation follows JavaDoc standards)

You can help by writing actual code for the methods listed in the `/src` folder and which don't have yet been written. The methods are included in the main `$.js` file via comments looking like `// import "methodName.js"`.

Alternatively, you can help improving the library's website in the `/docs/download` folder. This implies altering JavaScript and CSS files in the `/docs/download/assets_src` folder and the actual `index.html` in `/docs/download`.
